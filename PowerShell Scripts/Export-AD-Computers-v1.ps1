# This PowerShell script queries Active Directory for all computer objects
# and collects selected properties: Name, OperatingSystem, ManagedBy, DNSHostName, and Description.
# It resolves the ManagedBy field to a readable name when available.
# Results are exported to an Excel file in the current user's profile directory.
